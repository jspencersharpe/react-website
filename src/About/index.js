            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a developer at 247 Sports, and a graduate of Nashville Software School. I also play the bass and sleep in East Nashville, TN.</p>
            <p>Born and raised in Tulsa, OK, I studied Music Composition at Oral Roberts University. My wife, Amber, is the greatest woman of all time. We moved to Nashville in the Fall of 2013 and discover more fun things every day.</p>
            <p>I have been a fan of the <a href='http://www.nba.com/pacers/' target='_blank'>Indiana Pacers</a> my whole life. We are going to win a title. You just wait.</p>
